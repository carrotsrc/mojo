{"name":"Mojo","tagline":"Graphs, computer abstraction and operation","body":"MoJo is exploration into my continued fascination for graphs, as applied to computer hardware abstraction and operation. Currently in early stages of planning, design and even conceptually fairly up in the air, with very little idea of where it might lead.\r\n\r\n### To the basics of abstraction\r\n\r\n#### Perspective of operational architecture\r\n\r\n- CPU operations can be thought of as nodes, or operation nodes\r\n\r\n- A routine of opcodes is very much like a chain of operation nodes. A routine can be accessed via it's interconnectable start node.\r\n\r\n- The higher level concept of a loop is itself a routine with edges that feedback to the start node. The edges of a feedback are temporary in the concept of loops.\r\n\r\n- An application is a subgraph, a module within a much larger network of relationships and interactions. The nature of an application is a cluster of highly intra-connected nodes of routines, each made up of a network of nodes of operations.\r\n\r\n##### Perspective on conceptual architecture\r\n\r\nThe operational architecture changes the state of the conceptual network. The conceptual network is relationships between points of data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
