{"name":"Mojo","tagline":"Graphs, computer abstraction and operation","body":"MoJo is exploration into my continued fascination for graphs, as applied to computer hardware abstraction and operation. Currently in early stages of planning and design, with very little idea of where it might go.\r\n\r\n### From the basics of abstraction\r\n\r\n#### Perspective of operational architecture\r\n\r\n- CPU operations can be thought of as nodes, or operation nodes\r\n\r\n- A routine in assembly is very much like a chain of operation nodes. A routine can be accessed via it's interconnectable start node. Higher level concepts such as loops are in themselves routines with edges that feedback to the start node of the routine.\r\n\r\n- An application is a subgraph, a module within a much larger network of interactions. The nature of an application is a cluster of highly intra-connected nodes of routines, each made up of nodes of operations.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
