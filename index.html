			<p>
				MoJo is exploration into my continued fascination for graphs, as 
				applied to computer hardware abstraction and operation. Currently 
				in early stages of planning, design and even conceptually fairly up 
				in the air, with very little idea of where it might lead. This is 
				just a place to scratch notes and ideas down.

				Thoughts of operational architecture
			</h4>

			<p>
				The operational network is the various functional relationships
				of the entire system. At the moment, the edges define interaction
				and flow.
			</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		CPU operations can be thought of as nodes, or operation nodes
	</li>
	
	<li>
		A routine of opcodes is very much like a chain of operation nodes. A routine 
		can be accessed via it's interconnectable start node. It's start node is
		representative of the routine itself -- an entry point.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The higher level concept of a loop is itself a routine with a feedback 
		edge leading to the start node. The feedback edge is temporary.
	</li>

	<li>
		An application is a subgraph, a module, within a much larger network of 
		relationships and interactions. The nature of an application is a cluster 
		of highly intra-connected nodes of routines, each made up of a network of 
		operation nodes.
	</li>
</ul>

	Thoughts on conceptual architecture
</h5>

	<p>
		The operational architecture changes the state of the conceptual network. The 
		conceptual network is purely relationships between data points. In order to access
		a data point, there must be some form of edge leading to it; some valid
		relationship with it in the graph.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			Data points are, by themselves, arbitrary. A conceptual framework 
			projected on the data point and it's relationships is what gives it 
			meaning.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Files, or highly intra-connected conceptual modules, can be thought 
			of as chains of nodes again, much like the basis of the operational 
			network. A text file, for instance, is a chain of character nodes. It has 
			a start, interconnectable node and the chain leads to a leaf node or 
			EOF. The file is abstracted as a subgraph in the conceptual network.
		</li>
	</ul>

	Thoughts on source nodes
</h5>
	
	<p>
		There seems to be two forms of source node
	</p>
	<ul><li>Discrete data source</li>
		<li>(pseudo)Continuous data</li></ul>
	
	<p>
		The discrete data sources generate single packets/particles of data, 
		either once or over time. The packets may have a relationship to one
		another but it will be conceptually much higher level. A keyboard is
		an example of a discrete source node - the sequence of letters may
		have a conceptual relationship (e.g. a sentence) but that relationship
		only becomes apparent at a higher level.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The continuous data sources generate highly connected sequences, each
		node is directly related to it's siblings. e.g. raw sound data is a
		continuous data source, which may have an interleaved relationship. It
		can be thought of as 'pseudo' because digital information is by it's nature 
		discrete, but the relationship is that of being continuous.
	</p>

	<p>
		A discrete source node can generate data nodes which can later be related
		in terms of a larger concept, and these data nodes can become, in themselves,
		a form of continuous data. E.G. a discrete source node generates character nodes
		that are chained together as a continuous network, conceptually thought of as
		a letter to someone.
	</p>

	<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	</a>
	Thoughts on assemblers
</h5>
	
	<p>
		The assembler is a transformer network. It takes a network of continuous data (a 
		chain of nodes) and transforms them into a highly intraconnected network 
		of operation nodes.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is possible to think of the resultant sequence of nodes as a single chain 
		but that is not conceptually what the relationship between the nodes is.  It is
		the context of being an operation network that gives them meaning, which naturally
		forms them into the highly intraconnected graph.
	</p>

	<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	</a>
	Thoughts on Memory
</h5>
	<p>
		A memory address is a conceptual node and should only be accessible via
		a relational edge in the graph. The machine abstraction provides the initial
		relationship edge with the root node of the system (ignoring BIOS for now) 
		-- it says shift to this node (0x100000) and continue operational flow through 
		the network.
	</p>

	Thoughts on The Stack
</h5>
	<p>
		The stack is maybe the most dynamic part. It is the area where relationships
		are made, tested and broken.
	</p>

	Thoughts on Networks and Internet
</h5>
	
	<p>
		The Internet is a extension of the local computer's graph,
		operational and conceptual architecture alike. They are in no way different.
