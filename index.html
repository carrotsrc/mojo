				MoJo is exploration into my continued fascination for graphs, as 
				applied to computer hardware abstraction and operation. Currently 
				in early stages of planning, design and even conceptually fairly up 
				in the air, with very little idea of where it might lead. This is 
				just a place to scratch notes down.

<ul>
	<li>
		CPU operations can be thought of as nodes, or operation nodes
	</li>
	
	<li>
		A routine of opcodes is very much like a chain of operation nodes. A routine 
		can be accessed via it's interconnectable start node. It's start node is
		representative of the routine itself -- an entry point.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The higher level concept of a loop is itself a routine with a feedback 
		edge leading to the start node. The feedback edge is temporary.
	</li>

	<li>
		An application is a subgraph, a module, within a much larger network of 
		relationships and interactions. The nature of an application is a cluster 
		of highly intra-connected nodes of routines, each made up of a network of 
		operation nodes.
	</li>
</ul>

	Perspective on conceptual architecture
</h5>

	<p>
		The operational architecture changes the state of the conceptual network. The 
		conceptual network is purely relationships between data points. In order to access
		a data point, there must be some form of edge leading to it, some valid
		relationship with it in the graph.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
		Data points are, by themselves, arbitrary. A conceptual framework projected
		on the data point and it's relationships is what gives it meaning.
		</li>
	</ul>
